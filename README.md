## Acknowledgements

- This project is currently a proof-of-concept (POC) and WILL be subject to changes, updates, and fixes in the future.
- I've only tested this with Windows for now, but I plan on making releases for at least Linux as well!
- VidLer is a simple GUI for yt-dlp, ensuring a straightforward and reliable downloading experience. 
This means it's missing a lot of features or flashy design choices to make it as simple as possible (so my grandma can download stuff without calling me every time)!
